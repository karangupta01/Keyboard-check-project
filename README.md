# Keyboard Check Project

The Keyboard Check Project is a JavaScript-based application that detects and displays the key pressed on the keyboard in real time.
This project showcases essential JavaScript concepts like **event handling**, **DOM manipulation**, and **keyboard events**, providing an interactive and educational experience.

## How It Works
- Listens for `keydown` events to capture the key being pressed.
- Displays the keyâ€™s name and key code on the screen instantly.
- Uses `addEventListener()` to attach the event and respond in real time.

## JavaScript Concepts Used
- **Event Handling:** Captures user input through `keydown` and `keyup` events.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updates HTML content using methods like `getElementById()` and `textContent`.
- **Keyboard Events:** Uses `event.key` and `event.keyCode` to identify the pressed key.
- **Real-Time Interactivity:** Provides instant feedback by responding to user input immediately.

This project is perfect for learning how JavaScript interacts with user actions and updates the DOM efficiently.
